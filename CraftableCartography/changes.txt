- Fix: map now continues to track player movement if you have a JPS
- You can no longer recentre the map on your position by pressing space unless you have a JPS
- Prospecting pick mechanics updated: you must now manually enter the coordinates of a reading unless you have a JPS
- Added .recentermap as an alias of .recentremap
