- Owned elk (etc.?) now hidden unless you have a JPS
- Fixed benign error regarding JPS model
- Fixed sextant behaviour while moving
- Added a "primitive compass", which just shows the cardinal direction
- Compass movement now continues when you're not actively using it (you still need to use it to read it)
- Also fixed an oversight in the compass movement causing inconsistent behaviour
