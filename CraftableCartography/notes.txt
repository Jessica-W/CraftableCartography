VS map mod:
- Map, minimap, compass, coordinates, all disabled by default, requiring the following items
- Compass
	- gives access to direction, like what a compass do
- Sextant
	- when used, outputs current coordinates
	- short delay on use
- Temporal Sextant
	- gives access to coordinates display
- Map
	- gives access to map (but not minimap?)
	- player position(s) not displayed on map
	- require pigment in inventory to mark map?
	- require pigment to generate map?
	- disable map shortcut, require player to use map item?
	- store map markers on map itself; player loses/gains markers depending on map used?
- JPS (Jonas' Positioning System)
	- gives access to full suite: map, minimap, compass, coordinates, player position all restored
	- can be tuned to different channels; players in multiplayer can see eachother on map if and only if they have the same channel set
	- must be powered with temporal gears?

- map UI improvements probably necessary for this
	- centre on coordinates
	- reopen to same location as last closed

- useful bits
	- some kind of container item, to put map + sextant + compass in one slot
